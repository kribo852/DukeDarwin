## A library for running genetic algorithms

## Use
Call the functions `run_algorithm` or `simplified_run` in the class GeneticLibrary. There is an example of how to use the library in the test, 
GeneticLibraryTest.


## API
The api is made to look like my other libraries for genetic algorithms, for Rust and Python. The implementation of the libraries may however differ.
